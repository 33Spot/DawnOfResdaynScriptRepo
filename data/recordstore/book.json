In fact, she even tried to seduce him on his own counter. BUT, Jo'Lani was too caught up in his own head to notice her. So when HE started to be interested, she was getting uninterested. And long story short, she was too fast and Jo'Lani is terribly slow. What the worse part is tried to take her out on a date to know her better!! All that hard work for nothing! When he comes back from unintentionally getting drunk from too much wine, she lets him go! This one could barely count his own fingers at the time, let alone comprehend a break-up. She was the one who was being too pushy and trying to make seductive gestures in the first place....Jo'Lani is done with relationships. Too much heartache. <p>"
